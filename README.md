# Smoop Can't Sleep

- A simple 2D platformer-shooter that served as my introduction to programming and game development at the same time.
- Learned the basics of object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming, state management, and many other things over the course of 1.5 years of development.
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2019
- **Engine:** Unity 2019
- **Sounds:** [SFXR](https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)
- **Artwork:** Aseprite
- **Music:** FL Studio
- Didn't learn about the importance of Git until after finishing the project, so much of the project ended up being lost besides the code unfortunately. Future Unity projects should be playable when I upload them
